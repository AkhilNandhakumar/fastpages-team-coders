Learning Objective: Represent collections of related primitive and object reference data using two dimensional array objects | Array Vocab: Array = a data structure used to implement a collection (list) of primitive or object reference data | Element = a single value in the array | Index = the position of the element in the array (starts from 0) | Array Length = the number of elements in the array Is public, so can be accessed in any class | Is also final, so can’t change it after array has been created | . | Activity: write code to find the index number of the last element in this list: list = a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h | Index number = list.length - 1 | . | . | A 2D array is an array of arrays | They can be a better way to store data | Declaring a 2D array: DataType[][] nameOf2DArray | . | Initializing a 2D array new DataType[r][c] {} r = # of rows The # of arrays in the array | r = list.length c = # of columns | . | The # of elements in the inner arrays | c = list[0].length Activity: declare and initialize a sample array | . | . | . | . | . 8.1.2 . Warm-up: We will give them an array and they have to print every 3rd character . 8.1.3 . 8.2.1 . 8.2.2 . 8.2.3 .",
